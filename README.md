# CIS - Computing and Information Science

This repository contains my study notes and resources for the **B.Sc. in Computing and Information Science (CIS)** program at **Daffodil International University**. These notes are specifically for the **CIS** the course. The goal of this repository is to provide an organized collection of materials for each subject, which can be useful for my personal study and for sharing with others who are studying similar courses.

I have tried to summarize key concepts and topics covered in each subject, but I encourage you to refer to your official course slides, textbooks, and other materials for a deeper understanding.
